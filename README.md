# Bossfight
- The fight is generally faster, less idle time, less recovery time
- Most patterns are spiced up by adding some spikes in different spots, adding actual challenge to the fight
- Three phases with unique changes and patterns
- Designed to match the difficulty of act 3 heart bosses, its not meant to be the "average Hollow Knight modded boss"
